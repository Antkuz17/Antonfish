Anton: Just started the project. I’ve been wanting to build a chess engine for a long time now and think overall they are very cool and include lots of complex logic that would be amazing to learn. Currently, I’m not really sure what direction to go or what to start building. I’m gonna start by reading a bunch about how most engines work and what algorithms basic ones use. There are some very cool YouTube videos that I found that should also give some insight into what to start with. Note: this is my first time keeping such a concrete daily log. I think it will be nice to look back on progress and also use it as a docs tool to solve problems later on. Wish me luck.

Note: From here on, each entry will follow the devlogformat, this first entry is just a quick description of what the project is.


## [2025-11-10]

**Duration:** [2 30]

### Goal / Objective
> Begin to understand how chess engines work 

### Tasks Completed
- Chose bitboards as the representation of the chessboard to simplify move generation and board evaluation.
- Selected C++ for its performance and low-level control, suitable for engine development.
- Began looking at how search algorithms function.


### Next Steps / TODO
- Implement basic bitboard representation and piece placement.
- Continue research
